# SynPSG_PDF

A platform-independent API that facilitates the easy creation of PDF files from
applications written in Synergy DBL. SynPSG_PDF extends earlier work presented
in PDFKIT from the Synergy/DE Code Exchange by presenting a more OO-like, more
friendly and generally more usable API.

For additional information please refer to the documentation which you will
find in DOCUMENTATION\SynPSG_PDF.chm
