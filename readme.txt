Description:    A collection of Synergy DBL classes that facilitate the easy
                creation of PDF files. SynPSG.PDF extends the work done in
                PDFKIT from the Synergy Code Exchange by presenting a more
                OO-like, more friendly and generally more usable API. And
                SynPSG_PDF also includes documentation!

Requirements:   SynPSG_PDF requires Synergy/DE V10.3.1b or higher

                In order to use the SynPSG_PDF classes you need both the source
                code (PDFDBL.DBL) and HaruPDF shared libraries from PDFKIT. For
                your convenience we have included both with the SynPSG.PDF
                distribution.
