Description:    A collection of Synergy DBL classes that facilitate the easy
                creation of PDF files. SynPSG.PDF extends the work done in PDFKIT
                from the Synergy Code Exchange by presenting a more OO-like, more
                friendly and generally more usable API. And SynPSG.PDF also
                includes documentation! In order to use the SynPSG.PDF classes
                you need both the source code (pdfdbl.dbl) and HaruPDF shared
                libraries from PDFKIT. For your convenience we have included
                both with the SynPSG.PDF distribution.

Requirements    SynPSG.PDF requires Synergy/DE V10.3.1b on a Windows system.
